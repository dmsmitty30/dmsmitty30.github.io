An unusually warm & dry winter in Washington state has lead to an extremely meager mountain snowpack. Some places are worse
than others. Take for instance Hurricane Ridge. At 5,240 feet in the Olympic Mountain Range, This spot gets on average 400+ 
inches of snowfall per year, but as now, the landscape is about what you would expect to see in late September or October.

The webcam site [ZeitCam.com](https://zeitcam.com/) has been capturing and archiving images every 15 minutes from the 
[Hurricane Ridge Webcam](http://zeitcam.com/webcam/hurricaneridge) as well as other outdoor cams around the globe since 2011. 

Looking back over the years you can see that 2015 is quite an anomaly. Check out these images from February 17 of years past, going back to 2011. This year, Hurricane Ridge is not exactly the winter wonderland we're used to seeing.
